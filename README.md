This is a project I made for my own amusement and use, functioning very similiarly to my TaigaBomb project, with some logical differences.
The same persistence method (.vbs to startup) is used, by the logic for the payload differs in that instead of it being a certain time after activation, it will 
activate every Sunday upon startup, with a 1 in 4 chance to randomly activate upon startup on any other day of the week.
The name, music and icon used is the character "Marvelous Sunday" from the video game "Umamusume Pretty Derby".

Obviously, I don't own the music or character used in this project, and will take down this project if any issues with copyright arises.
